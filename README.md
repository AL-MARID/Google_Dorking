Google_Dorking Advanced Google Dork Filtering and Matching Script.  
Google_Dorking is a powerful script I made in Python 3.  
With this tool, you can search Google using any dork and get only URLs that contain the exact dork term inside the link itself, not just the page content.  
Google_Dorking helps you find admin panels, login pages, or any specific targets more accurately and professionally.
